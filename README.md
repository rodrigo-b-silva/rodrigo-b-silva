# Hi, I'm Rodrigo :wave::smile:

I'm a software developer who is passionate about open source technologies, creating solutions to make life easier for people and companies. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Front-end, Back-end and Mobile, mainly the Javascript Ecosystem (ReactJS, Angular, NodeJS and Electron), APIs (Rest, GraphQL and Socket), DevOps (Docker, Linux, AWS and Azure).

I build a lot of demos on this account. Most of them are projects that I develop during the study of courses and individual projects.

For more information about me and some of my experiences, check out my [LinkedIn - Rodrigo Barbosa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigobarbosa1993) ðŸ§
